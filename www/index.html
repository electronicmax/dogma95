			<h5>DOGMA 95 FOR APPS AND SERVICES</h5>

			<img id="logo" src="img/ethical.png" >

			<blockquote>
				Dogme 95 was an avant-garde filmmaking movement started in 1995 by the Danish directors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier" target="_blank">Lars von Trier</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vinterberg" target="_blank">Thomas Vinterberg</a>, who created the "Dogme 95 Manifesto" and the "Vow of Chastity" (Danish: kyskhedsl√∏fter). These were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was an attempt to take back power for the director as artist, as opposed to the studio.  <div class="source"> -- Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95">Dogma 95</a> </div>

				Smartphones have fundamentally changed society. There are over a billion people on this world who use smartphones every day, downloading from among the over 4 million apps available from the two major app marketplaces alone.  
			</p>
			<p>	
				Unfortunately, this technological transition is also simultaneously causing a dark, hidden world to bloom, unbeknownst to most users.  A vast market of personal information has emerged, in which data about people is siphoned through apps, collected, shared and sold, then used for targeted ads, and other forms of coercion and manipulation.  A single app may have hidden in it <a href="http://techscience.org/a/2015103001/" target="_blank">dozens of trackers that send data to third parties</a>. These trackers are not held accountable for the data they collect about people, and are completely invisible. This has become the norm, rather than the exception.
			</p> 
			<p>
				There should be a better way. Trustworthy apps that don't spy on users should be rewarded for their ethical conduct and responsible handling of data.  People should be able to find these apps easily, and be able to use them confident that their data will be used with respect.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why we are launching the Ethical Personal Data Initiative, a set of standards for allowing app makers to declare that their apps are <i>ethical</i> and to encourage such apps to be developed and adopted by users.
			</p>

			<h2>Principles</h2>			
			The principles of Ethical Data Initiative are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>No advertising</b> - This means the app or service must not collect or use any data for marketing or advertising purposes, directly or indirectly, e.g. itself or via any third party. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Proportionality</b> - To minimise risk to individuals, only data that is of <i>direct</i> or <i>potential use</i> for providing functionality should be collected.
				</li>
				<li><b>Transparency</b> - Full disclosure of third parties that may receive or handle data from the app or service is mandatory.
				</li>
				<li><b>Control</b> - Where possible, users should be able to entirely opt out of data transmission to third party services.</li>
				<!-- <li><b>No Propagation</b> - User data must not be propagated beyond the controllers without explicit consent.</li> -->
				<li><b>No Lock-In</b> -  Apps must allow users to take their data with them when they cease use of the service for any reason. </li>
				<li><b>Delete Me</b> - Apps must comply (to the extent possible) with requests from users to remove data about them.</li>
			</ul>
