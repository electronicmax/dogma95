			<blockquote>
				Dogme 95 was an avant-garde filmmaking movement started in 1995 by the Danish directors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier" target="_blank">Lars von Trier</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vinterberg" target="_blank">Thomas Vinterberg</a>, who created the "Dogme 95 Manifesto" and the "Vow of Chastity" (Danish: kyskhedsl√∏fter). These were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was an attempt to take back power for the director as artist, as opposed to the studio.  <div class="source"> -- Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95">Dogma 95</a> </div>

				Smartphones have fundamentally changed society. There are over a billion people on this world who use smartphones every day, downloading from among the over 4 million apps available from the two major app marketplaces alone.  
			</p>

			<p>	
				Unfortunately, this technological transition is also simultaneously causing a dark, hidden world to bloom, unbeknownst to most users.  A vast market of personal information has emerged, in which data about people is siphoned through apps, collected, shared and sold, then used for targeted ads, and other forms of coercion and manipulation.  A single app may have hidden in it <a href="http://techscience.org/a/2015103001/" target="_blank">dozens of trackers that send data to third parties</a>. These trackers are not held accountable for the data they collect about people, and are completely invisible. This has become the norm, rather than the exception.
			</p> 
			<p>
				There should be a better way. Trustworthy apps that don't spy on users should be rewarded for their ethical conduct and responsible handling of data.  People should be able to find these apps easily, and be able to use them confident that their data will be used with respect.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why we are launching the Ethical Personal Data Initiative, a set of standards for allowing app makers to declare that their apps are <i>ethical</i> andencourage such apps to be developed and adopted by users.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>No advertising.</b> - This means the app or service must <i>not share</i> any data with first or third party companies whose business model is to use this data for marketing or advertising purposes. None. Not even one.
				</li>
				<li><b>Proportionality</b> - Data should only be collected as necessary to actually 	benefit the user experience, or provide the services offered.
				</li>
				<li><b>Full disclosure of third parties</b> - Third parties that receive any 		at all must be declared and justifed and explained to users.
				</li>All data controllers are declared.</li>
				<li>Minimise data sent to third parties. Any third parties must be justified and clearly disclosed.
				<li>No lock in: Apps must allow users to take their data out of the services whenever they want.
				<li>Delete any time.
			</ul>

			Such behaviours directly undermine the progress that has been made, by directly threatening the ecosystems that have emerged, enabled by powerful wireless deviecs and pervasive network connectivity.
