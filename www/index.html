			<h5>DOGMA 95 FOR APPS AND SERVICES</h5>

			<blockquote>
				Dogme 95 was an avant-garde filmmaking movement started in 1995 by the Danish directors Lars won Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, who created the "Dogme 95 Manifesto" and the "Vow of Chastity" (Danish: kyskhedsl√∏fter).

				There should be a better way. Trustworthy apps that don't spy on users should be rewarded for their ethical conduct and responsible handling of data.  People should be able to find these apps easily, and be able to use them confident that their data will be used with respect.

				This is why we are launching the Ethical Personal Data Initiative (EthiDATA),
